# THE ADDR
There are three types of hex files
 - 16 bit addres I8X
 - 20 bit addres I16X
 - 32 bit address I32X
THe address width is not specified; probably one is default and this is already used by Python.
The 16-bit data words in the SDRAM are mapped into the eight-bit data format of the 
.HEX, .MCS, .EXO and .XES files using a Big Endian style. That is, the 16-bit word at 
location N in the SDRAM is stored in the eight-bit file with the upper eight bits at address 
2N and the lower eight bits at address 2N+1.
Therefore, if you don't write a multiple of 2. XSTOOLS starts complaining.
